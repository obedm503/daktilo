# why

there are 2 main reasons for me to blog:
- so that there's a place where people can find instructions on how to use stuff I made
- I've always wanted to write a blog but didn't have a reason ontil now

i chose the name camelCase because that's the accepted and recommended naming convention in javascript. javascipt is the language i know best and work on the most.

# how

because setting up a dedicated server with some complex cms is beyond what i need and simply not worth it, this blog lives on github and is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). jekyll is simple and capable enough for the kind of static blog I need. using jekyll means i don't have to be bothered by constantly updating a cms and extra plugins, but it also means i don't have to write a new html document for every blog post or worry about browser support as much. also, it's free.

the theme i decided on it called [daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io/). it's simple, and readable, and because of that extemely fast. its color make code blocks stand out: something extremely useful to those who don't like to read the post itself and go straight to the code ;)

For post creating and editing I currently use [dinllinger.io](http://dillinger.io/). Dillinger is a cloud based markdown editor. using it means I don't have to create the file locally, edit it, ``git add .``, ``git commit``, and ``git push``. the less work necessary for the same result, the better. this is my preferred workflow because I don't always work on the same machine, and in those cases portability is extremely important.

# content

on this blog you should expect to see posts on everything. everything from back end, to front end, to hybrid (cordiva, ionic and electron) development, and maybe some music production.

i don't promise a strict publishing schedule, but i do want to post every time i see the need to explain something.
