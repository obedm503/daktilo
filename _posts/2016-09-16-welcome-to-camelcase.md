# why

There are 2 main reasons for me to blog:


- so that there's a place where people can find instructions on how to use stuff I've made
- I've always wanted to write a blog but didn't have a reason to do so ontil now

I chose the name camelCase because that's the accepted and recommended naming convention in javascript. Javascipt is the language I know best and work on the most.

# how

Because setting up a dedicated server with some complex cms is beyond what I need and simply not worth it, this blog lives on [github](https://github.com/obedm503/obedm503.github.io/) and is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is simple and capable enough for the kind of static blog I need. Using jekyll means I don't have to be bothered by constantly updating a cms and extra plugins, but it also means I don't have to write a new html document for every blog post and worry about browser support. Also, it's free.

The theme I decided on is called [daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io/). It's simple, readable, and light-weight, and because of that, fast. Its colors make code blocks stand out: something useful for those who don't like to read the post itself and go straight into the code ;)

For post creating and posts I currently use [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/). Dillinger is a cloud based markdown editor. Using it means I don't have to create the file locally, edit it, ``git add .``, ``git commit``, and ``git push``. The less work necessary for the same result, the better. This is my preferred workflow because I don't always work on the same machine, and in those cases portability is extremely important.

# content

On this blog you should expect to see posts about everything: from back end, to front end, to hybrid (cordova, ionic or electron) development, and maybe some music production.

I won't promise a strict publishing schedule, but it is my desire to blog every time I see something that needs to be explained. camelCase should be considered a work in progress: something that will be polished with time, like a [stone in a river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumble_finishing).
