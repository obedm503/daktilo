As a developer of any sort, technical documentation is a necessary evil. If any user ever wants to use our script but finds no explanation on how to do so, they will leave. Writing good documentation is boring difficult enough. Writing the documentation in a way that is user friendly, is even worse. No one enjoys writing html and css. Yes, they make the text look better, but opening “[p](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)” tags on every paragraph is not worth it. 

>Note: If you host your projects on Github or Bitbucket, chances are you write your documentation, or at least readmes, in markdown. The purpose of this post is not convince you on using markdown, that was already written [here](http://lifehacker.com/5943320/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lists-and-notes).

This is where bootmark comes in. The bootmark project takes the presentation of the docs out of your hands. It takes markdown passes it through the magical showdown parser, splashes some fine bootstrap styling onto it, and Alakazam! Your plain text markdown now looks good and even has a table of contents.

The bootmark project was born out of laziness necessity. I was in dire need to make a quick [website](https://ncai-developers.github.io/) to display some links, but didn't wants to write the html for it. After much exploring through the jungles of the interwebs I found the [Strapdown](http://strapdownjs.com/) project. It did the job well enough. It parsed markdown to html on demand, and added some limited styling. After playing with it for a while, I found it did things in a way I didn’t like and that it hadn’t been updated in awhile. So like any good citizen of the internet, I [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) it, and thus bootmark was born. Bootmark has the added benefits of using [Bootswatch themes](http://bootswatch.com/), not being limited to use “[xmp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/xmp)”or “[textarea](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea)” elements and having its custom element so that you don’t have to write any code if you don’t want to. Also, external files can be loaded. This is the feature I find most useful.

Methods:


- Using the custom bootmark element
- Using any DOM element
- Using code

Requirements:


- Basic html knowledge; more on that [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction)
- Basic markdown knowledge; that is [here](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) or [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Method 1: <bootmark></bootmark>

The first and most convenient method uses the custom “bootmark” [tag](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/whatishtml.php#htmltags) with some custom [attributes](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp). It works both, for markdown in the same file, or markdown somewhere else.

### Step 1:  Write the typical html skeleton

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Any title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 2: Insert bootmark code

Insert the bootmark minified code bundle, or bootmark and its dependencies separately. Bootmark depends on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap's](http://getbootstrap.com/) js, [Showdown](http://showdownjs.github.io/demo/), and [showdown-prettify](https://github.com/showdownjs/prettify-extension). 

>Note: Since bootmark depends on Bootstrap’s javascript, and it, in turn, depends on jQuery, it made sense to use jQuery code all the way. 

{% highlight html %}
...
  <title>Any title</title>
  <script src="https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/dist/bootmark.bundle.min.js"></script>
...
{% endhightlight %}

### Step 3:  Add markdown inside the “bootmark” tag

Make sure to not indent the text. If text is indented or has 4 spaces before it, it’ll be interpreted as source code.

{% highlight html %}
...
<body>
  <bootmark>
# This is a title

This is the first paragraph

This is a list:

- first item
- second item

  </bootmark>
</body>
...
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 4: bootmark config

Specify the markdown configurations as attributes on the element.

{% highlight html %}
...
<bootmark
  css="https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/dist/bootmark.min.css"
  html="{
    theme:'paper'
  }">
...
{% endhighlight %}

>Note: On the [document ready event](https://api.jquery.com/ready/), bootmark will look for a bootmark element. If none is found, it will look for any element with id of “bootmark.”

>Note: If no fetch attribute with the url to an external markdown file is provided, bootmark will look for markdown inside the element. This applies to the bootmark element and any element with if of “bootmark.”

For more on the specific API look [here](https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/examples/index.html).

## Method 2: <any></any>

The second method is extremely similar to the first one, except that any DOM element can be used ([divs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) and [spans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) recommended) as long as it has an id of “bootmark” and all attributes are prefixed with “data-.” So, “css” becomes “data-css,” ”fetch” becomes “data-fetch,” etc. This is required by [html5 standard](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp).

>Note: This method was created with people who care about fully complying with the standards in mind.

## Method 3: Code

Sometimes you want to parse markdown at a specific point in time with input from your users, this is where plain code will solve the problem.

### Step 1:  Write the typical html skeleton

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Any title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 2: Insert bootmark code

Insert the bootmark minified code bundle, or bootmark and its dependencies separately. Bootmark depends on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap's](http://getbootstrap.com/) js, [Showdown](http://showdownjs.github.io/demo/), and [showdown-prettify](https://github.com/showdownjs/prettify-extension). 

{% highlight html %}
...
  <script src="https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/dist/bootmark.bundle.min.js">
  </script>
</head>
...
{% endhightlight %}

### Step 3: Insert some markdown

{% highlight html %}
...
<body>
  <div id=”anyId”>
# This is a title

This is the first paragraph

This is a list:

- first item
- second item

  </div>
</body>
...
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 4: bootmark config

Insert a script tag and inside it use jQuery code to get any element and pass it the configuration object. The only required property on the configuration object is “css.” If no other config is passed, bootmark will assume that the markdown is inside the element, and use its defaults.

>Note: All defaults are specified in the [Docs](https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/docs/index.html).

{% highlight html %}
...
  </body>
  <script>
    $('#anyId').bootmark({
      css: 'https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/dist/bootmark.min.css'
    });
  </script>
</html>
...
{% endhighlight %}

And that’s it. You’ve just saved 20 minutes on your next documentation showcase. For the sake of this how-to, I kept out several of the features bootmark has, features like: the ability to pass it markdown to the config object directly, the ability to indent paragraphs, or the ability to return a promise instead of the jQuery object, etc.
